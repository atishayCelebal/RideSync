# ARCHITECTURE.md for RideSync

## High-Level Architecture
The architecture of the RideSync platform is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and real-time solution for group ride management and fleet tracking. The system is divided into several key components:

1. **Frontend (React)**
   - User interface for group management, ride session control, and real-time location tracking.
   - Integrates with Google Maps for visualizing ride sessions.
   - Establishes WebSocket connections for real-time updates.

2. **Backend (Java, Spring Boot)**
   - Manages business logic and data processing.
   - Provides secure API endpoints for GPS devices to stream location data.
   - Consumes location data from Kafka for processing and validation.

3. **Data Streaming (Confluent)**
   - Handles real-time data ingestion from GPS devices.
   - Decouples data producers (GPS devices) from consumers (backend services).

4. **Database (PostgreSQL)**
   - Stores user accounts, ride groups, GPS device registrations, and historical data.

5. **Real-Time Communication**
   - Utilizes WebSockets for low-latency communication between the frontend and backend.

## Component Breakdown
- **Frontend Layer**
  - React application for user interaction.
  - Components for user registration, group management, and real-time dashboard.

- **Backend Layer**
  - Spring Boot application handling API requests and business logic.
  - Services for user management, device management, and ride session control.

- **Data Layer**
  - PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.
  - Kafka topics for real-time data processing.

## Service Boundaries
- The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs and WebSockets.
- The backend interacts with the PostgreSQL database for data persistence.
- The backend consumes location data from Kafka topics for processing.

## Security Enforcement
- User location data is secured and only visible to group members during active ride sessions.
- API endpoints for GPS devices are protected using API keys or device-specific tokens.

## Communication Flows
1. **User Registration and Group Management**
   - Users register and create ride groups via the frontend.
   - Group Admins can invite members and manage GPS devices.

2. **Real-Time Location Tracking**
   - GPS devices stream location data to the backend.
   - The backend processes this data and updates the frontend in real-time via WebSockets.

3. **Anomaly Detection**
   - The backend continuously analyzes location data for anomalies.
   - Alerts are generated and sent to the Group Admin's dashboard in real-time.

## Conclusion
The architecture of RideSync is designed to provide a seamless experience for users while ensuring the security and reliability of the system. The use of modern technologies such as React, Spring Boot, and Confluent allows for a scalable and efficient solution for group ride management and fleet tracking.
