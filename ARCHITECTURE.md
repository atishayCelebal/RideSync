# RideSync Architecture

## High-Level Architecture Overview
The architecture for RideSync will consist of the following key components:

1. **Frontend (React)**
   - User interface for group and user management.
   - Real-time dashboard displaying GPS data on Google Maps.
   - WebSocket connection for real-time updates.

2. **Backend (Java, Spring Boot)**
   - API endpoints for user and device management.
   - Ingestion of location data from GPS devices.
   - Processing of location data using Confluent Kafka.
   - Anomaly detection logic for real-time alerts.

3. **Data Streaming (Confluent)**
   - Real-time data pipeline for processing location streams.
   - Decoupling of data producers (GPS devices) and consumers (backend services).

4. **Database (PostgreSQL)**
   - Storage of user data, group information, and historical ride data.

5. **Real-Time Communication**
   - WebSockets for low-latency updates between the backend and frontend.

## Component Breakdown
- **Frontend Layer**
  - **React Application**: Handles user interactions, displays real-time data, and manages WebSocket connections.
  - **Google Maps Integration**: Visual representation of ride sessions and member locations.

- **Backend Layer**
  - **Spring Boot Application**: Manages business logic, user authentication, and API endpoints.
  - **Kafka Consumer**: Processes incoming location data and validates it against registered devices.

- **Data Layer**
  - **Confluent Kafka**: Manages real-time data streams and ensures reliable data ingestion.
  - **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores user profiles, ride groups, and historical data for analytics.

## Security Enforcement
- **Authentication and Authorization**: 
  - Use of API keys or device-specific tokens to secure the GPS data ingestion endpoint.
  - User location data is only accessible to group members during active ride sessions.

## Communication Flows
- **Data Flow**: 
  - GPS devices send location data to the backend via a secure API.
  - The backend processes this data and pushes updates to the frontend through WebSockets.
  
- **Alerting Mechanism**: 
  - Anomaly detection logic runs continuously during active ride sessions, generating alerts for the Group Admin when necessary.

## Scalability Considerations
- The architecture is designed to scale independently for data ingestion and processing, allowing for thousands of concurrently tracked devices without performance degradation.

## Availability
- The system aims for an uptime of 99.5% or higher, ensuring reliability for users during critical ride sessions.
